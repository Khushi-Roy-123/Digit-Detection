# Models (exclude if >100MB, but ours is 90MB so it's borderline okay. 
# Better to exclude if we don't want to push it, but for Streamlit Cloud deployment without training, we usually NEED the model.
# I will NOT exclude models/ folder so it gets pushed.
# But I will exclude the CSVs to save space.
